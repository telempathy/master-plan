Steps to manufacture an OpenBCI board

* Generate .BOM files from the [DesignSpark files](https://github.com/OpenBCI/V3_Hardware_Design_Files) or http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/02-Cyton
* Have PCBs printed by allpcb and SMT stencils (HASL lead free)
* Obtain SMT parts via BOM ([search forums](http://openbci.com/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/1201/who-has-built-the-openbci-parts-full-bom-suppliers) for people who have built and what BOM they used)
* Obtain solder paste and iron
* Build a rig and use stencil to attach SMT parts
