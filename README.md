# Telempathy master plan

## Background

### Global warming is an existential threat to our species. Why are we doing nothing about it?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming

### Humans are individually smart but collectively dumb. This is why we elect governments who aren't addressing global warming.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_mentality

### Optimal decision making requires optimal collaboration, which requires optimal empathy.

### Humans evolved to empathize and make decisions at small scales (>150 people). We are not equipped for planet level decision making.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number

### We are no longer subject to natural selection. Our evolution instead comes from collective knowledge and tools.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence

### We need to develop a tool to enable optimal empathy at scale, and therefore optimal decision making at scale.

## Plan

### 1) Develop a proof of concept device to enhance empathy and collaboration.

My proposal is this:

 * Create a device that reads EEG waves from one brain and transmits them to other brains.
 * For reading EEG waves, we could use an [OpenBCI headset](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage).
 * For inputting data, we could translate the EEG waves into audio waves and send them through the ears. (Longer term: [tDCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation), [TMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation)).
 * This allows emotional context to be transmitted without requiring physical presence.

### 2) Apply this device commercially to create a sustainable venture.

Possible commercial applications:

* If groups can demonstrably collaborate more effectively using a telempathy device, all businesses could benefit
* Helping autistic children learn emotional communication skills (thanks @ahdinosaur for this idea).
* Communicating with comatose patients with brain activity ([communicating with comatose patients using MRI](http://www.medpagetoday.com/neurology/headtrauma/40947)).

### 3) Use resource from commercial venture to create low cost device for everyone.

### 4) Improve world's decision making capacity, fix climate change and other planet level problems.
