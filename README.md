# Telempathy master plan

## Background

### Scientists agree climate change is an existential threat to our species. Why are we doing nothing about it?

### Humans are exceedingly bad at making good decisions in large groups. In part, this is why we elect governments who choose not to address climate change.

### Optimal decision making requires optimal collaboration.

### Optimal collaboration requires optimal empathy.

### Humans did not evolve to empathize and collaborate at large scales.

### We are no longer subject to natural selection. Our evolution instead comes from collective knowledge and tools.

### We need to develop a tool to enable better empathy at scale, and therefore better decision making at scale.

## Plan

### 1) Develop a proof of concept device to enhance empathy and collaboration.

### 2) Apply this device commercially to create a sustainable venture.

### 3) Use resource from commercial venture to create low cost device for everyone.

### 4) Improve world's decision making capacity, fix climate change and other planet level problems.
