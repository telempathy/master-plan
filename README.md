# Telempathy master plan

## Background

### Climate change is an existential threat to our species. Why are we doing nothing about it?

### Humans are individually smart but collectively dumb. This is why we elect governments who aren't addressing climate change.

### Optimal decision making requires optimal collaboration, which requires optimal empathy.

### Humans evolved to empathize and make decisions at small scales (>150 people). We are not equipped for planet level decision making.

### We are no longer subject to natural selection. Our evolution instead comes from collective knowledge and tools.

### We need to develop a tool to enable optimal empathy at scale, and therefore optimal decision making at scale.

## Plan

### 1) Develop a proof of concept device to enhance empathy and collaboration.

### 2) Apply this device commercially to create a sustainable venture.

### 3) Use resource from commercial venture to create low cost device for everyone.

### 4) Improve world's decision making capacity, fix climate change and other planet level problems.
